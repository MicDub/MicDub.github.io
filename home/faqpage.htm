<p><a name="1">1</a>. &quot;When I installed
DsTune/DsChordFinder, it says I have 0 days left for evaluation
and quits. What is wrong?&quot;</p>

<p>This happens when that program has already been used and
evaluated on your computer. Reinstalling it won't help, the only
thing you can do really is to remove the program from your system
or to order a full copy.</p>

<p>p.s. I've been receiving several of these questions lately.
Perhaps there is a conflict with another program.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name="2">2</a>. &quot;How do I uninstall DsTune and
DsChordFinder?&quot;</p>

<p>Simply delete the directory they're in. The installation
doesn't leave any files in your Windows or Windows/system
directory, so this will clear it out.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name="3">3</a>. &quot;I removed DsTune/DsChordFinder from
my computer and when I reinstalled it knew it had already been
installed. This means that your program is dirtying up my Windows
installation. I am not happy with you!&quot;</p>

<p>The programs do indeed use about 20 to 30 bytes of you
harddrive, without returning that space when you remove the
software. I do apologize for this, but the programs do this in a
way that follow Windows guidelines, so it won't slow down or
impede your system. The only effect is that when you for instance
install 1,000 programs like DsTune and DsChordFinder, you will
lose some 25 kb harddrive space.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name="4">4</a>. &quot;I use Smooth Editor. When I load this
particular text file, the program freezes when indicator shows
99% loaded.&quot;</p>

<p><em><strong>Answer</strong></em>: This problem is solved in
the new version 2.12. You can find it <a href="prod03.htm">here</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name="5">5</a>. &quot;When I run DsTune the program
suggests that I Calibrate. Since I don't own a tuning fork, I use
the 'Calibrate Automatically' option. Then my computer freezes
up.&quot;</p>

<p><em><strong>Answer</strong></em>: This calibration is
necessary on old 8 bit sound cards of inferior quality. When a
sample is played on such a card at a sample rate of 11025 Hz, it
is really played at a significantly higher or lower rate. This
leads to a similarly high or low reading of measured frequencies.
What the program does essentially is halt all computer activity,
play a sample and time exactly how long it takes the sound card
to play it. Some computers apparently cannot cope with a program
that stops all software. The solution for this problem is really
not to do the calibration but to choose the 'Assume correct
sample rates' option, because the large majority of sound cards
is more accurate than the automatic calibration. But if you still
don't trust your sound card and your computer freezes up on
performing an automatic calibration, you will need a tuning fork
to calibrate.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name="6">6</a>. &quot;When I run DsChordFinder 2.1 the
program suggests that I Calibrate. When I confirm, my computer
freezes up.&quot;</p>

<p><em><strong>Answer</strong></em>: For an explanation see the
answer to the previous question. For DsChordFinder a small
inaccuracy in sample rate is not very important. But since
version 2.1 doesn't offer an 'assume correct sample rates' a
different solution is necessary. Please download this file: <a
href="chfinder.ini">chfinder.ini</a> and put it in your
ChordFinder directory. This should solve the problem (when your
browser shows a 'No viewer for file type' message, choose the
'Save to disk' option).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name="8"></a>7. &quot;DsTune doesn't seem to hear the
guitar. The volume indicater isn't moving when I play a
string&quot;</p>

<p><em><strong>Answer</strong></em>: This is a mixer problem. You
need to start the mixer program for you sound card. For a sound
card with good drivers under Windows 95 you can double-click on
the speaker symbol on the task bar. First you need to mix in the
microphone, so you can hear it through your speakers when you tap
the microphone. But this may not be enough! You also must select
the microphone for recording. The Windows Sound Recorder does
this automatically, but for DsTune you may have to do this
manually. In the mixer for Windows 95 you need to select
'recording' in the dialog that appears when you select
options/properties.</p>
