          </strong>No questions yet </p>
          <p><a name="1"></a>1. <strong>"When I installed DsTune/DsChordFinder, it says I have 0 days left for evaluation and quits. What is wrong?" </strong></p>
          <p>This happens when that program has already been used and evaluated on your computer. Reinstalling it won't help, the only thing you can do really is to remove the program from your system or to order a full copy. </p>
          <p>p.s. I've been receiving several of these questions lately. Perhaps there is a conflict with another program. </p>
          <p><a name="2"></a>2. <strong>"How do I uninstall DsTune and DsChordFinder?" </strong></p>
          <p>Simply delete the directory they're in. The installation doesn't leave any files in your Windows or Windows/system directory, so this will clear it out. </p>
          <p><a name="3"></a>3. <strong>"I removed DsTune/DsChordFinder from my computer and when I reinstalled it knew it had already been installed. This means that your program is dirtying up my Windows installation. I am not happy with you!" </strong></p>
          <p>The programs do indeed use about 20 to 30 bytes of you harddrive, without returning that space when you remove the software. I do apologize for this, but the programs do this in a way that follow Windows guidelines, so it won't slow down or impede your system. The only effect is that when you for instance install 1,000 programs like DsTune and DsChordFinder, you will lose some 25 kb harddrive space. </p>
          <p><a name="4"></a>4. <strong>"I use Smooth Editor. When I load this particular text file, the program freezes when indicator shows 99% loaded." </strong></p>
          <p>Answer : This problem is solved in the new version 2.12. You can find it <a href="smed.html">here</a>. </p>
          <p><a name="5"></a>5. <strong>"When I run DsTune the program suggests that I Calibrate. Since I don't own a tuning fork, I use the 'Calibrate Automatically' option. Then my computer freezes up." </strong></p>
          <p>Answer : This calibration is necessary on old 8 bit sound cards of inferior quality. When a sample is played on such a card at a sample rate of 11025 Hz, it is really played at a significantly higher or lower rate. This leads to a similarly high or low reading of measured frequencies. What the program does essentially is halt all computer activity, play a sample and time exactly how long it takes the sound card to play it. Some computers apparently cannot cope with a program that stops all software. The solution for this problem is really not to do the calibration but to choose the 'Assume correct sample rates' option, because the large majority of sound cards is more accurate than the automatic calibration. But if you still don't trust your sound card and your computer freezes up on performing an automatic calibration, you will need a tuning fork to calibrate. </p>
          <p><a name="6"></a>6. <strong>"When I run DsChordFinder 2.1 the program suggests that I Calibrate. When I confirm, my computer freezes up." </strong></p>
          <p>Answer : For an explanation see the answer to the previous question. For DsChordFinder a small inaccuracy in sample rate is not very important. But since version 2.1 doesn't offer an 'assume correct sample rates' a different solution is necessary. Please download this file: <a href="http://www.dubbeldam.com/chfinder.ini">chfinder.ini </a> and put it in your ChordFinder directory. This should solve the problem (when your browser shows a 'No viewer for file type' message, choose the 'Save to disk' option). </p>
          <p><a name="7"></a>7. <strong>"DsTune doesn't seem to hear the guitar. The volume indicater isn't moving when I play a string" </strong></p>
          <p>Answer : This is a mixer problem. You need to start the mixer program for you sound card. For a sound card with good drivers under Windows 95 you can double-click on the speaker symbol on the task bar. First you need to mix in the microphone, so you can hear it through your speakers when you tap the microphone. But this may not be enough! You also must select the microphone for recording. The Windows Sound Recorder does this automatically, but for DsTune you may have to do this manually. In the mixer for Windows 95 you need to select 'recording' in the dialog that appears when you select options/properties. </p>
